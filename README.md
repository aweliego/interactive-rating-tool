## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- TypeScript

### What I learned

This is my first project using Sass and TypeScript outside of course guided projects (albeit in fairly moderate amounts).

After valuable feedback, I decided to add one of the above users stories ("See a disabled Submit button until a number rating is selected") and to implement it.

I'm still trying to get the hang of TS, it's really hard for me to understand how it benefits the code at times, and I feel like most of the TS code I wrote was because TS "made" me by showing errors if I didn't.

I definitely learned a lot about the basics of Sass in this project and found it really handy, especially when it comes to switch between styles for active, hover and disabled states.

Besides that, the project helped me consolidate stuff like fading in elements with CSS transitions.
